The Rap Of Baguette:                  
I'm a yummy baguette                                                                                                                
my name is brett         
look up pictures of me on the internet                                                                                                                           
 don't take me to the vet                                                                                                                                              
 i'm very upset                                                  
keep me as your pet 
i'm making a threat
let's do a duet
i'm reading the sixth grade gazette
i'm in the kitchenette
i'm not a prophet
i'm keeping a secret
i'm flying a jet
i'm wearing a headset
i'm gonna reset
I'm not from tibet
Mymom is Juliet
I watch the sunset
There's a guy who I just met
I can see his silhouette
I can't play a clarinet
But I know someone named Bernadette
I am soaking wet
But there's nothing I regret
As I do a pirouhette
I am a baguette.
