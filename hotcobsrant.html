Dear Ms. Bowers,

Here is my 24 hour takeaway from today’s Shared Inquiry. I spoke once but I had a whole lot more to say BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS HAVE NO BRAIN.

Young Henry is one of the dumbest literary characters I have ever met. I mean he literally met Keiko a few months ago and he makes so many foolish decisions to try to “save” her. It’s literally a 6th grade romance that will probably end in 5 months! GET A GRIP MAN. I’M NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE TO HENRY BUT IF HE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT HE’S DOING ONCE HE’D BE SO MUCH BETTER OFF. MY MAN IS LITERALLY BLINDED BY 6TH GRADE LOVE. I GET THAT HE FEELS ACCEPTED AND ALL AND HE DOESN’T HAVE ANY OTHER FAMILY OR FRIENDS THAT HE LIKES, BUT GOD. YOU ARE RISKING SO MANY LIVES! DO YOU HAVE A BRAIN HENRY? YOU’RE LIKE A SODA THAT ISNT FIZZY. IT’S LIKE DRIVING THROUGH MONTANA AND YOU CAN’T EVEN SEE A PLANT IN SIGHT. IF HE EVEN THOUGHT ONCE ABOUT HOW HE IS RISKING HIS OWN LIFE, THE LIVES OF THE OKABE FAMILY, THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE. AND ON THAT NOTE LETS TALK ABOUT KEIKO. I STILL GOT NO CLUE HOW TO PRONAOUNCE HER NAME BUT I DO KNOW THAT SHE ISN’T ANY BETTER THAN HENRY. WHY WOULD YOU TELL HENRY TO ILLEGALLY SEND YOU SOE GIFTS? YOU ARE LIRTTERHUY MANIPULATING HIM AND KNOWING THAT HES GOT NO BRAIB HE WILL JUST OBEY LIKE A DAMN ROBOT. GET A BRAIN DUDE. THIS IS JUST A SIXTH GRADE ROMANCE THAT PROBABLY WONT EVEN ;LAST IN REGULAR CONDITIONS BUT I YOU CAIM TO LOVE EACH OTHER TTHAT ,MUCH (WHICH YOU DON’T) WHY DON’T YOU USE SOME EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND FREAKIN  CARTE FOR HENRYN! YOU ARE NOT SHOWING THAT YOU LOVE HIM! YOU ARE BEING A SELFISH IDIOTWHO IS JUST LIKE ANY EMOTIONAL ABUSER WE WOULD HEAR ABOUT IN SEL CLASS. I CANT DESCRIBE IN WORDS HOW MAD I AM AT BOTH OF THEM RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE LITERALLY IN YOUR PRIME, LITERALLY 20 YEARS YOUNGER THAN JESUS WHEN HE GAVE HIS LIFE UP BYAS. THE HUMAN MIND STARTS DECLINING AT AGE 27, IF THIS IS THE PEAK OF YOUR MIND THEN I’M NOT HOPEFUL FOR WHAT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IS GOING  TO BE LIKE. THEY AR “NOT USING THEIR MINDS” RIGHT NOW. AAND THIS “SERIOUS ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP” OF THEIRS IS DELUSIONAL. THEUY NEED TO GO TO COUPLES THERAPY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A DUDE WHO WORSHIPS HIS PARTNER LIKE THEYRE A FREAKING PHAROAH AND SOMEONE WHO MANIPULATES THE GUY WHO IS ALREADY MINDLESS. I GET THEY ARE KIDS AND THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR OR WHATEVER BUT THESE 6TH GRADER SHOULD KNOW NOT TO LET THEIR EMOTIONS CLOUD THEIR MINDS (WHICH AGAIN, I’M QUESTIONING IF THEY EVEN EXIST). HENRY THINKS HE IS BEING ALL HEROIC BUT HE IS BEING SO NAÏVE THAT HE DOESN’T EVEN REALIZE HE’S PUTTING LIVES AT RISK. SO MANY LIVES HE’S PUTTING AT RISK NOT EVEN HIS OWN. I FEEL BAD SINCE HE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS GOOD VALUES AND IS A GOOD HUMAN BUT THERE IS A POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO START MATURING AND HE HAS NOT DONE THAT, AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT. AND WHILE HENRY IS JUST PLAIN STUPID KEIKO HAS TO GO AND BURDEN HIM WITH MORE ISSUES. MY GOD. HAVE SOME SELFLESSNESS WOMAN. PLEASE FOR HENRY’S SAKE. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS CLEARLY TOXIC. THEY NEED TO GO TO COUPLES THERAPY RIGHT NOW.

Sorry for ranting there was a lot to say. It was interesting to read the book, and I guess it’s natural that young kids would make bad decisions. I guess I forgot they were only 6th graders after all they were going through.

Thank you for your time,
Rohan
